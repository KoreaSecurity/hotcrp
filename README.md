HotCRP Conference Review Software [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kohler/hotcrp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kohler/hotcrp)
=================================

HotCRP is the best available software for managing the conference
review process, including paper submission, review and comment
management, rebuttals, and the PC meeting. Its main strengths are
flexibility and ease of use in the review process, especially through
smart paper search and an extensive tagging facility. It is widely
used in computer science conferences and for internal review processes
at several large companies.

Multitrack conferences with per-track deadlines should use other software.

HotCRP is the open-source version of the software running on
[hotcrp.com](https://hotcrp.com). If you want to run HotCRP without setting
up your own server, use hotcrp.com.
